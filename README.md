<h1>Create user names with Powershell Script</h1>

<p>
  I used a Microsoft Excel sheet and added 20 users for each columns. I also put MD as a command when save as a bat.
  After saving in the Desktop folder, I ran the script and it will automatically add under User Active Directory Computers and Users.
